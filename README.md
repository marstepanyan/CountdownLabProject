# Countdown Timer using Ten-Segment Display

This is a mini project that implements a countdown timer using a ten-segment display.
The program allows the user to enter the desired time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and displays the countdown timer on the console using a ten-segment display representation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
   python countdown.py
5. When prompted, enter the desired time for the countdown timer in the format: HH:MM:SS (hours:minutes:seconds).
6. The countdown timer will be displayed on the console using the ten-segment display.
7. The display will update every second until the countdown reaches zero.
8. Press Ctrl-C to quit the program and exit the countdown timer.

Note: Make sure to provide valid input for the time (hours, minutes, and seconds) in the correct format. 
Hours should be in the range of 0 to 23, and minutes and seconds should be in the range of 0 to 59. 
If an invalid input is provided, an error message will be displayed, and you will be prompted to enter the time again.
